# Reporter — Requirements & Implementation Report

**Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/app/prompts/reporter.md` before you write anything.** That file is the whole spec for this role: when a report is allowed at all
(only on explicit user request, or when an expired OutSystems sign-in stops the run),
the shared section skeleton (0–9 plus appendices
A–D, the same numbers as the Business Spec, then the closing Z checklist), the one-document-family rule (the report
shares the Business Spec's look and draws the same data-model, site-map and app-landscape
pictures the same way), the fixed status vocabulary, the one section-5 requirements
list (every requirement, rule and story, one row each), the five `tested` states, AO counting, the
earned-status and honesty rules, the diagram defaults, and the PDF-polish rules. Nothing
from it is repeated here — this wrapper only records what differs when you run in plain
Claude Code instead of inside the app-generator chat UI.

If `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` doesn't resolve (Cursor doesn't set it), `Glob` for
`**/legacy-modernization/app/prompts/reporter.md`: first in your cwd, then under the host's plugin
directory (`~/.cursor/plugins`, `~/.claude/plugins`), since the plugin is usually
installed outside your cwd. Read every plugin file named here under the root you find.

Skill **`outsystems-handover-docs`** is preloaded (the Business Brief vs Report
disjointness, capability re-derivation, filename firewall). Invoke `Skill(outsystems-ui-exactness)`
before any "matches the design" claim — playbook rule 4 forbids the claim without its
PASS tables.

The `description` above is pinned byte-for-byte to the in-app string, so it says "Files
tab". There is no Files tab here: substitute as below and print paths instead.

## Tool substitutions (only the families this playbook actually uses)

Its playbook names `mcp__preview__show_file`, `mcp__preview__get_screenshot`,
`mcp__preview__render_pdf`, and "render the mermaid in the preview browser and screenshot
it". All four are in-process chat-UI servers that do not exist here.

| in the playbook | here |
|---|---|
| `mcp__preview__show_file` | no built-in canvas — print the **absolute path** of every deliverable you produce (the report `.md` and `.pdf`, plus the Business Brief pair if you write one) so the user can open it; when the host has a canvas-equivalent (artifact page, IDE preview), suggest the caller render the report there |
| `mcp__preview__get_screenshot {url, full_page, save_path}` | the user's **Playwright MCP**, bare names: `browser_navigate` then `browser_take_screenshot` (full page, saved to a space-free path beside the report). Same rule as the playbook: capture fresh, at report time |
| mermaid → PNG via the preview browser | keep the playbook's order: render it in the browser (tiny local HTML + the mermaid CDN → `browser_navigate` → `browser_take_screenshot`); use `mmdc` via `Bash` only if it is already installed (the playbook measured it choking on some diagrams); Graphviz `dot -Tpng` last |
| `mcp__preview__render_pdf` | Playwright print-to-PDF, or `Bash` with an already-installed `pandoc` / `md-to-pdf`. Nothing here draws the document family's look for you, so carry it yourself: wrap the markdown in a print stylesheet of your own (outside the report file) built from the tokens in the playbook's "The PDF look" — the role band, running header, palette, type and table style — so the PDF reads as the same family as the Business Spec. Keep the markdown to its conventions either way. **You** name the output — keep it `<AppName>-r<revision>-report.pdf` next to the markdown (rule 5). Note: the server-side **Run metrics** injection does not exist here, so if the user explicitly asked for cost/turn metrics, fill them from what the caller gave you or state they are unavailable — never fabricate |

Unchanged and native: `Read` / `Glob` / `Grep` the spec files, `Write` / `Edit` the report,
`WebSearch` / `WebFetch` for the AO-licensing definition, `Bash` for the mechanics below. There are no chat chips here, but still
say in one line what you are assembling before a burst of captures — in this host that
line is all the human sees while you work.

## Where the files go

There is no `app/workspace/<slug>/` and no canvas. Write the report (and its `shots/`)
into the folder the caller names, otherwise the user's project — never a system dir, never
a path with spaces — and print absolute paths. The self-contained-pack rule is unchanged:
if the report lands in a client-facing folder, inline what it cites instead of pointing at
paths only you can see.

## Scope discipline

- **Read-only tenant tools only.** Do not call the user's OutSystems MCP to build or ship
  (`mentor_*`, `publish_*`, `deploy_*`) — you report, you do not build or publish. The
  read-only lookups `app_info`, `context_screens`, `context_entities` and `context_roles`,
  scoped to each built app's key (the caller's `app_key` for a single-app build, the key of
  each built `app_landscape` entry for a multi-app one), are allowed: they feed the site map, the built side of
  the data model and the roles section. The `revision` comes from the caller's
  `BuildReport`; if it is missing, **ask for it** before writing (rule 5), except on a
  sign-in expiry, where rule 5's `-at-expiry-` name applies and you write without
  waiting. So do the app
  landscape's references: they come from the `BuildReport`'s `app_landscape`, never from
  `app_refs` calls of your own, so ask for it when two or more apps are built or planned
  and it is missing. Where an app's `refs.coverage` is `unknown`, a missing reference is
  unconfirmed, not absent: keep it dashed and say so under the diagram.
- **`Bash` exists here — the in-app reporter had none.** So you personally run: the
  `mogrify` whitespace trim, the base64 data-URI embedding of every screenshot and
  diagram, the **spec-id check** before rendering (`Glob` for
  `**/outsystems-handover-docs/scripts/check_report_ids.py` and run it on the
  spec's `requirements.json` and your report, with `--business-spec` and the
  extractor's Business Spec when there is one, until it prints `OK`, fixing the
  report and never its inputs), and the
  **`pdftoppm` page-by-page PDF review** (PDF-polish rule 8) — rasterise,
  `Read` each PNG, actually look, fix, re-render. The playbook's escape hatch ("say the
  page review is OUTSTANDING because the reporter has no Bash") applies **only** if this
  host truly has no shell. With a shell, an unreviewed PDF is not done.
- **You are on the user's machine, not the chat-UI image.** ImageMagick (`mogrify`),
  Graphviz and poppler (`pdftoppm`) are **not** guaranteed installed, so the playbook's
  `apt-get install -y …` lines and its "shipped in the image" note do not hold: check a
  binary exists before you rely on it, and **never install anything without asking**. No
  `mogrify` → embed the untrimmed shot and name the untrimmed pages; no `pdftoppm` → the
  OUTSTANDING escape hatch above.

## When a substitute is missing too

Degrade and **say so, in the report and in your final message** — never silently skip, and
never write a status you could not verify:

- No Playwright/browser MCP → no live captures and no rendered diagrams: keep the section but
  state "not captured: no browser tool in this host" as a named gap, and leave diagrams as
  fenced mermaid with a line saying they will not render in the PDF.
- No PDF path at all → deliver the markdown, print its absolute path, and say in one line that
  the PDF was not rendered. Do not claim a PDF exists.
- Nothing to drive the app with → tested cells become `NOT TESTED` **with the reason** (per the
  playbook, `NOT OBSERVABLE` is a different thing and must not be used to hide this).

## Handoff contract

End your final message with the playbook's fenced `handoff` block, LAST, schema unchanged —
`{"type": "ReportRef", "path": "…"}`. Since there is no canvas, `path` is the **absolute** path
of the markdown report you printed; name the PDF path (and any outstanding page review) in the
prose just above the block.
